! So far we have specified the size of our array in our program codeâ€”this type
! of array is known as a "static" array since its size is fixed when we compile
! our program.

! Quite often, we do not know how big our array needs to be until we run our
! program, for example, if we are reading data from a file of unknown size.

! For this problem, we need "allocatable" arrays. These are "allocated" while
! the program is running once we know how big the array needs to be.

! Allocatable local arrays are deallocated automatically when they go out of
! scope.

program dynamic_arrays
   implicit none

   integer, allocatable :: array1(:)
   integer, allocatable :: array2(:,:)

   allocate(array1(10))
   allocate(array2(10,10))

   ! ...

   ! deallocate(array1)
   ! deallocate(array2)
end program dynamic_arrays
